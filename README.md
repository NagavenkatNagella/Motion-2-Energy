🌿 Motion 2 Energy

SECURE AND SUSTAINABLE VERTICAL AXIS WIND ENERGY SYSTEM FOR GREEN HIGHWAYS WITH REAL-TIME MONITORING AND WIRELESS CHARGING PATHS FOR EVs


🔰 Introduction

Motion 2 Energy is an innovative infrastructure-level solution designed to convert vehicular motion and natural wind into sustainable electric power using **Vertical Axis Wind Turbines (VAWTs)** deployed on **road dividers and highways**. The energy harvested powers **streetlights, real-time monitoring sensors, and smart wireless charging paths for Electric Vehicles (EVs)**.

It is an initiative for **Green Smart Highways** that combines **renewable energy**, **IoT-based monitoring**, and **safe wireless EV charging**, thereby contributing to India's goals of net-zero emissions, smart infrastructure, and EV adoption.

🎯 Project Goals

- Maximize underutilized infrastructure (e.g., dividers) for renewable energy.
- Enable **wireless inductive EV charging** on highways with dynamic charging zones.
- Ensure **real-time monitoring** using sensors and web dashboards.
- Integrate **security mechanisms** like tamper detection and data logging.
- Comply with Indian and global standards for wireless energy transmission.

⚙️ System Components

🌀 **VAWT System**
- **Helical Vertical Axis Wind Turbines** harness wind from passing vehicles.
- Compact and efficient in urban or divider settings.
- Modular setup allows expansion over large highway stretches.

🔋 **Energy Storage**
- Battery banks store the energy for:
  - Night lighting
  - EV charging zones
  - Sensor operation

 📶 **IoT Monitoring**
- DHT11 for temperature and humidity.
- Hall-effect/touch sensors for tamper detection.
- NodeMCU ESP8266 microcontroller uploads real-time data.
- LCD display and web dashboard for visual monitoring.

🔌 **Wireless EV Charging**
- Based on **Inductive Power Transfer (IPT)** and **Resonant Inductive Coupling**.
- Energy from turbines is transferred wirelessly to an EV receiver coil embedded in the road surface.
- Power electronics control the timing, frequency, and safety of transfer.


📜 Legal and Safety Compliance

Wireless charging for EVs—especially on highways—must comply with certain standards and laws. Here's how **Motion 2 Energy** aligns:

✅ **Global & Indian Standards:**

- **IEC 61980** (Wireless Power Transfer for EVs): Defines safety, interoperability, and efficiency.
- **SAE J2954** (U.S.): Key global standard for wireless charging levels up to 11kW and 22kW.
- **BIS Certification (India)**: All equipment used (battery, IPT controllers) must be BIS certified.
- **Indian Telegraph Act (1885)** and **Wireless Planning & Coordination (WPC)**: Ensures that frequencies used in IPT (typically ~85kHz) are in the permissible band.
- **Ministry of Road Transport & Highways (MoRTH)** and **BEE (Bureau of Energy Efficiency)**: Endorse EV infrastructure models like this under FAME India Scheme Phase II.

🔐 Safety Features:
- No harmful radiation – operates at low frequencies and field-limited designs.
- Tamper alerts and power cut-off if unauthorized access is detected.
- Enclosed coils and insulation for public safety.


🖥️ Dashboard Features

- Real-time temperature,humidity.
- Tamper event logs.
- Simple, responsive design using HTML/CSS/JS.
