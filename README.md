🔌 **Wireless Charging Infrastructure**

⚡ Underlying Physics: How Wireless Charging Works

Wireless charging for Electric Vehicles (EVs) is rooted in fundamental electromagnetic laws:

**Faraday’s Law of Induction**: A changing magnetic field induces an electric current in a nearby coil. This is the core principle of how the receiver coil in the EV generates electricity from the magnetic field.

**Ampere’s Law**: An electric current passing through a conductor generates a magnetic field, which is how the transmitter coil (embedded in the road) produces the oscillating magnetic field.

**Lenz’s Law**: The induced current in the receiver opposes the change in magnetic flux, providing built-in safety and control mechanisms.

🔋 **Real-world Applications**:

Smartphones (e.g., iPhones): Operate on the same electromagnetic principles—Faraday’s and Ampere’s Laws. They use inductive charging via coils in the charging pad and the phone. Although the scale and power levels differ, the foundational laws are identical.

EVs in Motion 2 Energy: Use large-scale Inductive Power Transfer (IPT) systems at ~85 kHz. When an EV passes over the embedded coil, its receiver coil picks up the field and converts it to battery charging current.

This shared physics across scales proves the system's scientific soundness and scalability from consumer electronics to highway infrastructure.
